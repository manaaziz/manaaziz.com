title: How the heck am I going to do this?!?!
---

So me and one of my close friends from home decided that we were going to move to Barcelona after finish our degrees. My friend Radek just finished his bachelor's degree in Business Administration and I just finished my master's in statistics. I will be leaving to Spain on September 9th, where I will stay with my host family for the month of September. I will spend the three weeks that I am with them looking for a job and an apartment. Then, Radek will meet me on October 7th so that we can split the rent.

As of right now, we are one month out. I am spending much of my time looking for jobs and alerting my network in Barcelona of my arrival. I have found a few leads for legitimate jobs, where I can use my data science/math/statistics skills, as Barcelona has a growing tech startup scene. Hopefully I can land a decent job for when I get there. If not, I will take my resume and go to every cafe, restaurant, and store in Barcelona until somebody gives me a job!

Something about getting to Barcelona and having no other choice but to build a life for myself really excites me. It will certainly be hard at first, but I have the confidence and faith in myself that I will end up both happy and successful with my endeavor of finding my life in the Catalan capital.
