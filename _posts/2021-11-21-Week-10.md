title: Week 10 - Back & Forth
---
<p> I went to Madrid and back, the boys went to Milan and Cologne and back, Arane came to Barcelona and went back to Madrid, and then me and Arane will go to Sevilla and back. There is a song called <i>Back and Forth</i> that I really like by a guy named Sebastian Paul. He needs a little back and forth. So do I. That song should be the anthem of this post. In fact, I will link it below (click the picture for the Spotify link): </p>

<h3> MADRID </h3>

<p> 6AM. Barcelona Sants, once again. This time, instead of heading into the city, I am headed out. After zombie-ing my way down to the train station from my house, I got on the train with 6 minutes to spare. My sleep schedule is really screwed up these days, so waking up is really hard when you don’t usually go to bed until 3 or 4AM. Anyways, it is 6 in the morning, everyone on the train is half asleep, trying to sleep, or trying to get work done before starting the week in Madrid. And OF COURSE there has to be a couple of fatass Americans talking SUPER loud in English about how “my sorority does ____” and how “NOLA for Madri Gras was so fun I barely remember it”. Everyone on the train was so fed up with them after about 20 minutes, but they wouldn’t shut up. I made eye contact with three different people on the train, giving a disgusted look and signaling at them. After about an hour, I thought they were finally going to shut the hell up, praying that I would finally get a break from their voices, they decided to watch TikToks with the volume all the way up, cackling and talking about them. This continued for another hour. I almost envied the Spaniards, because at least they didn’t have to lose brain cells by listening to the subjects of their conversation. No wonder people in the world hate Americans. I do too. </p>

<p> Arane came and picked me up at the train station upon my arrival and took me straight to the Rastro. The Rastro is a Madrid staple; every Sunday people from all over put up little stands and sell used clothes, vintage items, books, and even food. A quiet neighborhood transform into a packed, bustling flea market. It is probably the closest thing I have found to a thrift shop here in Spain. In other words, it was my kind of place. Arane and I had a great time looking at all the junk, searching for patches, and digging through piles and piles of second hand Levis. Unfortunately, I didn’t find any Levis that were in my size; it sucks to have a 29cm waist :( </p>

<p> After the Rastro, we went back home to Arane’s, where I would just barely catch Alvaro before he left to go back to the police academy in Ávila. I was so tired after sleeping 3 hours, listening to the ignorant Americans on the train, and walking all around the Rastro that I wanted to get home and sleep. Me and Arane were already working out where I would sleep when Alvaro emerged from his room in his running clothes. I decided not to pass up the opportunity to go on a Sunday morning run through the Retiro with my boy, so I put aside my fatigue and laced up my Stan Smiths. We ended up running for an hour through a very packed Retiro, taking in the pleasant views and trying our best to dodge all the people on the different pathways. </p>

<p> Once we got back, Alvaro and his girlfriend headed out and me and Arane went shopping for some food. She really wanted some cookie dough ice cream that they only sell at this one supermarket called Dia. When the one right next to her house didn’t have it, we ended up going on a mission, walking a few kilometers to FOUR different Dias looking for her ice cream. I had bought some pistachio ice cream at the first super market, and when we got back home it was half-melted. We settled for getting stuff to make home-made edible cookie dough. Well actually, we had everything at home except for the vanilla extract. Who would have thought that vanilla extract would be such a weird item in Spain. I ended up paying FOUR euros for the tiniest bottle of vanilla extract that I have ever seen. When we got home, we ate spaghetti bolognese for dinner and made the cookie dough for dessert, which we ate as we played the WII. Playing the Wii is much more fun that you are probably thinking, I promise. We played WiiParty, where I kicked ass with my beginner’s luck and then got my ass kicked in round 2. It’s okay though, I got my revenge when we whipped out the WiiTennis. After WiiSports, we sat around and watched the third season of “YOU” until the early hours of the morning. </p>

<p> The next morning we had to wake up early to go and validate our tickets for the Van Gogh museum on Wednesday, so once we finally got back home, we planted ourselves on the couch and put on “YOU”. When the afternoon came around, we were having a really hard time getting up off of the couch. The only thing that ended up getting us off the couch was our hunger, forcing us to make the trek all the way down the hall to the kitchen. Our plan was to go to a very special spot to watch the sunset, but by the time we finally got up and moving, it was 6PM and the sun had already set. We settled for a night walk through the Retiro, which is one of my personal favorite things to do in Madrid, especially in such good company. On the way back, we met up with Laura (one of Arane’s friends who I am very fond of) and got churros and chocolate after a cold walk home. The guy that gave us the churros was so nice that he gave us three free heart-shaped churros on top of the extra churros that he gave us with our order. After that, we went home to chat with Valle (Arane’s mom) until we decided we were hungry enough for some döner kebabs (aka more junk food). I told the guy at the place that I wanted mine spicy, to which he responded “you can put your own hot sauce on, so that way if you burn yourself, you can’t blame me”. Apparently, their definition of “hot” is much different from mine, because I when we got home, my mouth was burning with the 8 little drops of sauce that I put on my food. Luckily I had the cookie dough to soak up all the heat :) </p>

<p> With Tuesday came my lunch date with Francisco. Francisco, for those of you who haven’t been keeping up with my posts, appears in weeks 3 and 7. He is a very wonderful and generous old man that I met serendipitously on the metro. On this third occasion of meeting him, I found out much more about him. He was born in the thick of the depression (1934, to be precise), but he comes from a wealthy family of Valladolid. He spent his entire life working as an architect between the richest areas of Madrid and Valladolid. He owns homes in the wealthiest areas of Galicia and Castilla de Leon, and Madrid. No wonder he can afford to treat me to 70-euro lunches all over Spain. PLUS, this time he gave me 150 euros in cash as a “Christmas gift”, which paid for ALL of the trips that I have taken/planned since I have been here. After our lunch, I convinced Francisco to let me treat him to a coffee, which we sat and drank until Arane came and picked me up. </p>

<p> After leaving the coffee shop, we headed downtown to meet our friend Aitana, who would take us to this amazing rooftop terrace, complete with a view of the sun setting over the west side of Madrid. We had to wait in line to get in by a massive, bald Romanian bouncer. I mean this guy was scary; he looked like he ate the bones of Soviet Russians for breakfast, and then washed it down with the tears of gypsy children. On top of that, he was wearing an all-black suit, looking like he just got back from a funeral. ANYWAYS, when we got to the front, I realized that I had lost my mask (typical Mana). So I tried to put my head down and walk in without my mask, so we didn’t have to leave, get a mask, and then wait in the line once again. When the bouncer caught me, I tried to keep going, patting down my pockets acting like I was looking for my mask, while saying “yeaaaah I have it here, just a second”. He, being from Romania and probably knowing the tricks taught to me by my Persian father, knew I was full of shit. He proceeded to grab my arm and escort me out of the building, telling me not to come back until I had a mask. Despite the girls’ dissuasion, I ended up going into the optometrist next door without a mask and asked very nicely so I didn’t have to buy a pack of masks at an overpriced store. Once I got the mask, we went back into the line. I made eye contact with my Eastern European buddy through the sliding glass door at the entrance, waving and pointing at my mask. He purposely made us wait longer than we really needed to, but when he finally let us in, he made sure to reprimand me about the mask. </p>
  
<!--  He proceeded to grab my arm very forcefully, dragged me to the door, and quite literally THREW me out of the lobby.  </p> -->

<p> We got to the rooftop right in time for the sunset, and enjoyed some overpriced drinks as the sun got swallowed by the horizon. We told stories, laughed at each other doing tongue twisters, and we even made fun of our Romanian friend, who we named “Dmitri”. On our way out, I ended up pulling him aside and shook his hand, saying “Look Dmitri, I’m sorry about earlier. I thought I could get by, but you were too smart to let me get away with bullshit”. He ended up saying it was okay and gave me a couple of pats on the chest that were so hard they could have bruised me. I think his brutish pats were a symbol of mutual admiration; one for me being “smart” enough to try to BS my way in without a mask, and one for him being “smart” enough to see through the bullshit. </p>

<p> After that, Aitana took us to this super cool Japanese market. It looked like any other other building in Madrid, but when you go in what seems like a little hole in the wall, it’s like you are transported into a hip, Japanese food court. Since it was a little overpriced, we just ordered a couple of egg rolls for each of us, then opting for a much cheaper McDonalds before parting ways. Since I refuse to eat the actual food at McDonalds, I got a McFlurry and fries, which won me some horrified looks from the girls when I dipped the latter into the former. I swear, I have probably gone to McDonalds more times in the past month than I have in the past 5 years. As if the McFlurry wasn’t enough, Arane and I decided to go to her favorite frozen yogurt joint on the way home. After all the junk, we were feeling bad enough to embark on the cold, hour-long trek from downtown Madrid. Arane walks very fast. In fact she walks so fast, that she will actually get 3 or 4 steps in front of me before she realizes that she is leaving me in the dust. She is also kind, so she will slow down to my pace, until she unconsciously starts speeding ahead, that is. By the time we got home, we were ready to get under some blankets and watch… you guessed it: “YOU” LOL. </p>

<p> Once again, we spent the morning laying around doing pretty much nothing. For those of you dumbfounded by me doing so much nothing, this particular doing nothing is actually quite okay with me. In fact, I actually very much loved doing nothing. Since I have already seen/done most of the touristic things in Madrid, I don’t feel any need to go out and see anything in particular. And then there is bigger reason, which is that I am really content with just sitting around and spending time with one of my most favorite people on Earth. Anyways, we finally got our butts off the couch to cook Iranian rice and make some very delicious oven-roasted tomatoes. Once Valle got home, we set out to the Van Gogh museum, where we were awe-stricken by the fascinating history, crazy life, and beautiful works of the late Dutch artist. Well I will say that while Arane’s mom enthusiastically went from exhibit to exhibit, Arane and I spent a lot of time goofing off. The way I would explain it is with a story. Because we laugh and giggle so much when we are together, Valle once scolded Arane and I for drinking too much, thinking we were drunk when we were just… well.. laughing and giggling like a couple of drunks. At least we are happy sober-drunks :) </p>

<p> Anyways, after the museum, we hit a coffee shop and headed to the train station. The Madrid-Atocha train station is BEAUTIFUL; it has a big space in the middle filled with all kinds of lush green trees. It also has a bunch of different floors and platforms. Even from a Barcelona-biased perspective, it is WAY better than Barcelona-Sants. BUT for whatever reason they scam people with the bathrooms. Literally right below where you go through security to get on the train, they have bathrooms that you have to pay $1.50 to get in to use the bathroom. Of course, I am way too cheap to pay that kind of money to use the bathroom. I figured I would just wait until I got on the train and use the surely-much-less-clean for free. But as soon as I went through security, there was a free bathroom RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE. I kinda felt bad for some of the people that went through security with me after I left the paid bathroom. </p>

<p> This goodbye was the easiest goodbye I have ever had to say to Arane, probably because I was going to see her in exactly 48 hours in Barcelona LOL. Hopefully the goodbye is this “dry” when I leave for Vegas from Madrid. I doubt it :") </p>

<h3> BARCELONA </h3>
<p> The future awaits :) </p>
