title: Week 11 - The Penultimate Trip
---

<p> 6AM. Barcelona Sants. Once again. I dont know how many times I have written those two sentences, but all roads start from Barcelona Sants. This time I am not alone; I have Arane. After zombie-ing our way down to the train station, we took the Renfe out to the airport. Thankfully, everything went smoothly. We got to the train station early, the train came on time, and I was able to finesse the system, buying a one-zone train ticket instead of a three zone train ticket, saving a total of two and a half euros. The excitement of the upcoming trip kept us going until we got into our seats. I tried to read my book club book for a little, but after about 20 minutes a wave of drowsiness came over me, making it hard for me to keep my eyes open. The only thing able to wake me up was the pilot’s very poor landing, which felt more like a crash landing than anything else. </p>

<p> We hustled to the bus stop after sluggishly getting off the plane, getting there RIGHT as the bus was leaving. The bus dropped us off by the central train station, leaving us a 40 minute walk to our hotel. Before embarking on the trek, we stopped in a park to eat our pre-packed sandwiches and snacks where we encountered the only sketchy-looking person we were to find in Sevilla. The guy got really close to us and stared us down with a look that made me ready to hit him with my backpack. Luckily, we were in a park in broad daylight, so nothing would have happened. After this little interaction, the man went back to sitting as still as a rock in the grass, staring down into the depths of hell below him. I was still hungry after our sandwich picnic, so we stopped again at a little bar, where we met Diego. Diego was our very funny and super nice waiter. He lived and worked in the US for a little while, but left without paying his taxes, so he cannot go back without paying both the back-taxes and the fine on top of it. It’s funny to me that someone would go to the US and evade taxes, but then come to Spain and pay double the amount in taxes. When I did the typical go-to-the-bathroom-and-pay, he knew what I was doing and said “the girl is Spanish right? you have to let her pay”. Because he said that, I ceded and let Arane pay, only to find out that they don’t accept card, leaving me to pay in the end since I was the one with cash LOL. </p> 

<p> After quickly dropping our stuff off at the hotel, we were back to business as usual, being out and about and exploring. We walked through the city, going from monument to monument taking in all the sights. Sevilla is such a beautiful city. The buildings are not super tall and perfectly planned like they are in Barcelona. The streets aren’t smoothly paved and don’t have wide pedestrian walkaways or bike lanes either. They are all made of stones, with old, sunset-colored buildings coming up on each side, with stone sidewalks that sometimes disappear all together. The bigger streets are all lined with orange trees, while the smaller alleys have terracing vines or flowers. Walking through the older parts of the city is definitely an intimate experience. You almost feel like you are gently held by the old streets. The squares have little carts of people selling flowers, books, olives, or whatever seasonal item. There is definitely a special charm that is present throughout the city. </p> 

<p> We found ourselves in the central park of the city after about an hour of taking in the beauty of the city, where the famous Plaza de España resides. We ventured through the park, sitting to enjoy the serenity of the park under the climbing rose vines. Once we recuperated a little bit of energy, we went to Plaza de España. I am not sure exactly how to explain the grandeur of the plaza and the palace, but I will try. When you are standing in front of the plaza, you actually cannot see all of it in its entirety, because your peripheral vision physically does not go wide enough. When you step into the plaza, its sheer size makes you feel so tiny. In fact, if you were to put the hundreds of people in the plaza in a big group, we would still look tiny. It is no wonder that they have used it in Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and of course, my favorite movie, the Dictator! We stuck around the plaza for a couple of hours, admiring its mosaics, bridges, and maps of the different Spanish provinces, as well as taking a boat ride around the moat. There was a guy selling the touristic junk on a sheet that I started talking to. He was a really nice guy and I could tell that he was just trying to make a living by selling the items. After a while, he asked me if he could trust me to watch his inventory while he goes and gets food. Little did he know he picked the perfect guy for the job, because not only did I watch his stuff, I tried to sell it in his absence. Unfortunately I didn’t get any sales, but I had a good time and embarrassed Arane trying. She made a point to sit very far away and act like she didn’t know me LOL. </p>

<p> Once we felt sufficiently belittled by Plaza de España, we took a walk up the river to the Golden Tower and the old bullfighting ring. Unfortunately we got rained out and decided it to be a good time to head back to the hotel, since in all honesty we were exhausted. After hustling to the hotel in the cold rain, the bed was calling our name. We decided to sleep an hour and a half, but ended up sleeping three since my alarm never went off (or maybe it did?). Because now were behind on time, we hustled to get up and go see the Setas of Sevilla, which is a modern structure built over an old square, that has become one of the principal attractions for tourists as well as a hang-out spot for locals. Built on top of an archaeological site, the sinuous structure towers about 5 stories into the air, just above all of the surrounding buildings. During the day, it provides shade to the plaza below, which is necessary during the hot, Andalusian summers, and by night it lights up in all different colors, giving an elegant and intimate view of the city from the top. We were very lucky that the rain stopped just in time to give us a clear view of the entire city when we climbed the structure. </p>

<p> Before heading to eat, we went to the supermarket to buy some stuff for lunch the following day as well as some snacks and beer for the room after dinner. I REALLY wanted bread for no good reason, and for whatever reason, nowhere had bread. So we ended up going to like 4 different supermarkets before finding one that was about to close in 10 minutes that had ONE (very shitty) baguette left. After our wild goose chase for bread, we stopped at home, dropped off our food (putting the perishable items outside on the balcony), and headed to a highly-rated tapas joint. This place, occupying the very corner of a flatiron-building-shaped building, was smaller than my room in Las Vegas. There were enough seats for about 20 people to sit, and all of them were full except for 2 of them. Lucky us. In fact, as it got later, more and more people started pouring in, most of them literally standing and eating on what looked like tiny little shelves protruding from the walls. It may have only been a Tuesday night, but man, was this place poppin’. There were a group of 40-something French women, who went to every party in the bar with their pretty pink lipstick, drawing on people’s faces. When it became our turn, we reluctantly said yes, letting them paint some “eye shadow” on Arane, and a heart around my mouth. They were very drunk, but they made the restaurant very lively. Then the food came, and everything was 10/10. The food was delicious, the presentation was fantastic, the price was reasonable, and the portions were ample. It is a shame that we found the best place in Sevilla to eat on our first night, because the next day no other places would live up to it. We had four tapas, two beers, and a delicious tiramisu for dessert, all for 27 euros. </p>

<p> After sleeping only 5 hours or so, we woke up early to have breakfast at the hotel. When the one-star hotel promised a complimentary continental breakfast, I really wasn’t expecting that much, meaning that I was very surprised at the delicious breakfast buffet that we came down to. Stuffed full of food and ready to go, we checked out and headed to the Triana Bridge to take in the views of the Amsterdam-esque buildings along the river. I had Arane take a couple of pictures of me for the memory, when a guy come up to us, asking us if he could take some pictures of us. Turns out, this guy, Pablo, was a nomad photographer, who charges quite a pretty penny for his services. He was so nice and ended up taking some awesome pictures of us for free, and got my email to send them to me later. Definitely another “why always me?” moment, but this time is a good way. </p> 

<p> We continued down the river, enjoying the sunny, warm Andalusian weather until we got to back to the central park. We spent some time walking through the opposite side of the park as the previous day until we settled down by the same pond as before to eat our snacks while watching the swans. One of the swans actually had the courage to get within a foot from me, which was intriguing yet terrifying. Recharged, we walked over to Plaza de España, where we sat and watched the flamenco dancers from a safe distance. By safe distance, I mean close enough to see the dancing and hear the music, but far enough to not have to pay the people after. On the way to the bus station where we would catch the bus back to the airport, we stopped at another tapas joint where, in comparison to the other place, we got tourist trapped. Similar prices, but with smaller portions, worse vibes, and shitty service. We thought we ordered a 5-euro tapa of calamari, but we ended up getting a 15-euro entire fried squid. Even though it was much more than we asked for, it was SO SO freaking good, with homemade batter and fresh squid. </p>

<p> The second place that we stopped on the way to the bus station would be an American staple, McDonalds. I really regret to say that I have been to McDonalds so many times this trip, but there is no cheaper place to get coffee. Arane has the McDonalds app that gives her an offer for a big boy coffee with milk for one euro, which would cost me about three or four euros anywhere else. Unfortunately, it happened to be the first day of the girl making my coffee, and I got just milk LOL. What really sucks is that I didn’t realize until it was too last since I got a free ice cream cone that I had to eat first. But the universe made up for it, because once we arrived at the bus station after killing some time along the river on a dock, they were giving out free Coke Zeros, which I got to drink two of since Arane didn’t want hers. Apparently CocaCola tweaked the Coke Zero recipe to make it taste a little more like the real coke. I prefer Diet Coke <i>because</i> it tastes different from real Coke, so it wasn’t really anything that excited me. </p>
