    When I tell people that I am going to do my PhD, everyone assumes that I am going to be doing it in mathematics, statistics, or some other related field. And when I tell them that I am actually doing it in hospitality, everyone is always so surprised. I supppose it is a rather unintuitive next step. It is definitely not where most math guys end up. But while it may seem like an unnatural next step to everyone else, I feel like I am right where I should be. I was never that passionate about mathematics or statistics. The truth is, I chose to do mathematics when I started college just because it was the hardest thing I could think to do. Then, I chose statistics for my masters because it was the most interesting next step. I am thankful to be in hospitality, where I can finally use my skills passionately.

    I am in a unique position going into my PhD. With my quantitative background, I know I will be able to look at things from a different perspective. I may lack some of the experience and subject-matter knowledge that my peers have, but I will have other strengths that few others in the field have. On top of that, I have been around the Hotel College my entire life, and I have somewhat of an inside source through my dad.

    My graduate assistantship will actually be through the business college. I was fortunate enough to be hand-picked by Dr. Yong Li, head of the Troesh Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and a distinguished scholar. I am extremely excited for this opportunity to learn from an elite academic and be around the business college, where I have a lot of great contacts.

    I went through a long period of feeling lost in life. During my gap year, I tried to collect as much life experience as possible with the sole objective of finding direction in life. Now that I finally feel like I am right where I need to be, and it is relieving and exciting.
