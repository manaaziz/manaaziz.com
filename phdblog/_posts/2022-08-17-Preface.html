  <p>RIP to my "bum" year.</p> 
  
  <p>After completing my master's degree in May of 2021 after four years of very hard work, I decided that I wasn't ready to get a "big boy" job. I was never passionate about math or statistics. Truth be told, I did math at UNLV because it was the hardest thing I could chose to do. </p>
  <p>Some people are really fortunate to know what they are passionate about. Or at least what they want to do in life. </p>
  <p>Some people are also really fortunate to find out what they are passionate about at some point along the way. </p> 
  <p> <i>I was not so lucky.</i> </p> 
  <p> I tried really hard to be passionate about math. Then I tried really hard to be passionate about insurance. And then I tried really hard to be passionate about statistics. At the end of the day, the only thing I was really doing with a passion was trying hard. So once I got all of my schooling out of the way, I decided that I was going to try really hard at being happy, collecting life experience, and hopefully finding some direction along the way.</p>
