  <p> RIP to my "bum" year. </p> 
  
  <p> I was always the kid that was far ahead of the rest, so not being that person for once felt like a fall from grace, at least in my own eyes. For me, to not be a high-achiever was to be a bum. So I spent a long time away from the professional world - mostly out of embarrassment. But I am no longer embarrassed. For the first time, I was learning and seeking out my passions on my own terms. In fact, I felt liberated. This past year has been one of the most happy, fulfilling, and formative years of my life, and I am proud of everything that I learned and accomplished. This is the account of my journey.</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <p> After completing both my bachelor's and master's degrees May of 2021, I decided that I wasn't ready to get a "big boy" job. I was scared of starting a career too young and growing up too soon, not living my youth to the fullest. I was scared of getting a job that I didn't feel passion for and being miserable for years. I was scared of taking the wrong path. </p> 
  
  <p> I was never passionate about math or statistics. Truth be told, I did math at UNLV because it was the hardest thing I could choose to do. Some people are really fortunate to know what they are passionate about. Or at least what they want to do in life. Some people are also really fortunate to find out what they are passionate about at some point along the way. </p> 
  
  <p> <i>I was not so lucky.</i> </p> 
  
  <p> I tried really hard to be passionate about math. Then I tried really hard to be passionate about insurance. And then I tried really hard to be passionate about statistics. At the end of the day, the only thing I was really doing with a passion was trying hard. So once I got all of my schooling out of the way (or so I thought), I decided that I was going to try really hard at being happy, collecting life experience, learning at every turn, and hopefully finding some direction along the way. </p>
  
  <p> This pursuit took me far and wide. I ended up spending two months couch surfing in Utah, two more months couch surfing in Hawaii, and three months living in Barcelona, Spain on my own. I traveled far and wide. I saw the snow-capped Rockies, the crystal-clear blue waters of Formentera, and the seemingly-infinite dunes of the Sahara Desert. In fact, the majority of my time was spent away from home. Many people envied me because I was "getting lost" in all of these beautiful destinations. The irony was that I wasn't <i>getting</i> lost - I <i>was</i> lost and I was trying to get found. </p>
  
  <p> But as clich√© as it sounds, I found myself along the way. I found that what I loved most was learning, and <i>boy, did I learn</i>.
    
  <p> I learned to create a life for myself, to live that life with an open mind, and to learn in every situation. In fact, if you want to read some specific lessons, check out <a href="https://manaaziz.com/bcnblog/Encore/">this</a> blog post from my time in Barcelona. I learned so many hard skills along the way too - from how to code this webpage to how to lay tile. At the end of it all, I came to see that I wasn't a "bum" and nor was anybody else. I learned that we are all just trying to find our path in our own way. </p>
  
  <p> So when it came to making a decision about my future, I decided to keep learning. I chose to do my PhD in hospitality. While I might not know so much about the subject matter, I feel it deep in my bones. I was born in <i>the</i> city of hospitality and I have experienced different forms of hospitality all around the globe. I love that it is a people-oriented way of learning about the world, and people make me happy. It can also once again take me far and wide, where I can continue to learn about the things that I do not know. </p>
    
  <p> My end goal is to become a professor. I really look forward to sharing all of the knowledge that I will continue to eagerly attain. But most of all, I hope to help those who haven't found a passion, and to give direction to those who feel lost. </p>
