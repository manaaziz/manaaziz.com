  <p> RIP to my "bum" year.</p> 
  <p> I was always the kid that was far ahead of the rest, so not being that person for once like a fall from grace, at least in my own eyes. I spent a long time away from the professional world mostly out of embarrassment, but I am no longer embarrassed anymore. </p>
  
  <p> After four years of hard work, I completed my master's degree in May of 2021. But I decided that I wasn't ready to get a "big boy" job. I was scared of starting a career too young and growing up too soon, not living my youth to the fullest. I was scared of getting a job that I didn't feel passion for and being miserable for years. I was scared of taking the wrong path. </p> 
  
  <p> I was never passionate about math or statistics. Truth be told, I did math at UNLV because it was the hardest thing I could chose to do. Some people are really fortunate to know what they are passionate about. Or at least what they want to do in life. Some people are also really fortunate to find out what they are passionate about at some point along the way. </p> 
  
  <p> <i>I was not so lucky.</i> </p> 
  
  <p> I tried really hard to be passionate about math. Then I tried really hard to be passionate about insurance. And then I tried really hard to be passionate about statistics. At the end of the day, the only thing I was really doing with a passion was trying hard. So once I got all of my schooling out of the way, I decided that I was going to try really hard at being happy, collecting life experience, learning at every turn, and hopefully finding some direction along the way. </p>
  
  <p> This pursuit took me far and wide. I ended up spending two months couch surfing in Utah, two more months couch surfing in Hawaii, and three months living in Barcelona, Spain. I traveled far and wide. I saw the snow-capped Rockies, the crystal-clear blue waters of Formentera, and the seemingly-infinite dunes of the Sahara Desert. In fact, the majority of my time was spent away from home. Many people envied me because I was "getting lost" in all of these beautiful destinations. The irony was that I wasn't getting lost. I <i>was</i> lost and I was trying to get found. </p>
  
  <p> But I also spent time at home. I learned what it was like to live on my own. </p>
