My name is Mana. I like to travel, but for me it isn't about the destination. As much as I love certain places, it is mostly about the people that are around me and the experiences that I can have and share. In fact, sometimes I get emotional thinking about what amazing people I have around me. This love for travel has driven me to Barcelona, Spain with the objective to make a life for myself. 

I asked a bunch of my closest friends to come up with some words to describe me and the overwhelming majority of them used the words: 
* smart(ass)  
* energetic  
* fashionable  
* organized  
* talkative  

I have also been referred to in many different ways over the years, some of those being the following:
* Hessam #2
* Manguera
* Mini Messi
* Don Andres
* Americanito

**This blog recounts the story of the Americanito making a life for himself in Barcelona.**

### Background Info

I was born and raised in *fabulous* Las Vegas, Nevada for better or for worse. I did my undergraduate degree in mathematics at UNLV (Go Rebs!) and my masters in statistics at NC State (Go Pack!). Some of my hobbies include soccer, skating (roller-, ice-, and -boarding), and listening to music. I am a very social person, and I believe in bringing (positive) energy to any social interaction that I engage in. My current focus in life to foster relationships that put me in a position to say "yes" to doing cool things or new opportunities.
