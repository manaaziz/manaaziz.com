<center><h2> The Garda Family </h2></center>

<p>The Meet Hostel. I think that I wouldn’t have enjoyed myself SO much if it weren’t for the amazing hostel that I stayed in. I don’t really stay in hostels all that often, since I usually prefer to go places where I have friends and stay with them. But this hostel was absolutely amazing. It was right next to the water, clean, had great service and cheap food, and most importantly, was full of amazing people.</p>

<p>From the moment that I walked in, I started talking to a couple of English-speakers and we just sort of became a family. And then our family grew when we met a couple of Germans walked over to us and started to chat. And then it just kept growing from there, until we were just all one big happy family. We spent all night talking and laughing and drinking. We exchanged stories, played musical instruments, and watched movies together. It was crazy because I felt like I knew these people my whole life. And I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.</p>

<p>Lake Garda was absolutely gorgeous. We walked through the old downtown area, jumped off the pier, and pretty often had at least one too many to drink. And by the time it was all over, it felt like it all went by in the blink of an eye. But it really did, because two days go by very quickly. But I am happy to say that I managed to make some life-long friends in the blip that was my time there. </p>
