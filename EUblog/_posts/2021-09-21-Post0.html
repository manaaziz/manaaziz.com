<p>These past couple of months have had me running in so many different directions all at once. I have been involved in so many projects, events, and extracurriculars that I feel really burned out moving into summer. </p>

<p>But I am hoping that this trip will reinvigorate me.  </p>

<p>I will be traveling to Europe for exactly one month, where all I will be living out of an extremely small backpack. This is because I will be flying the discount airlines all around Europe, which are even more strict than the likes of Frontier and Spirit. Normally, it wouldn’t be a challenge for me, but because part of my trip is business, I will have to dress professionally. </p>

<p>Because of that, I had to wear dress clothes while traveling… which were not exactly as comfortable as sweat pants might have been. But at least people treated me like an international businessman.  </p>

<p>By the time I got on the train from Amsterdam to Breda, I was so tired that I was actually starting to doze off. It took everything in my power to keep myself awake so I wouldn’t miss the stop. Luckily, the landscape was absolutely beautiful. </p>

<p>I was so well-received my Marli and family. It’s funny, because I have only met them one time previously when I was about 10, but it feels like I have always been family and I have known them forever. I am seriously looking forward to spending time with them :) </p>
